# LCFSC: Official Implementation for the paper "Robust Image Semantic Coding With Learnable CSI Fusion Masking Over MIMO Fading Channels" in IEEE TWC.

You can use train.py to train your own model.

The MIMO CSI is generated by the paper "A general 3-D non-stationary 5G wireless channel model".

The UDIS-D dataset can be found in www.github.com/nie-lang/UnsupervisedDeepImageStitching.

The code are in the "master" branch.
